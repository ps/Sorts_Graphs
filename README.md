Sorts and Graphs
================
This repo contains Java implementations with basic explanations of various crucial sort algorithms and data structures.

####Sort algorithms
* Insertion Sort 
* Heap Sort 
* Merge Sort 
* Quick Sort 

####Structures 
* Binary Tree [Tree_operations directory]
* Hash Table [Hash_Table directory]

####Graphs [Graph directory] 
* Basic Graph Structure [with Vertices and weighted Edges]
* Depth-First-Traversal 
* Breadth-First-Traversal [todo]
* Shortest-Path/ Longest-Path (Dijkstra) with basic array as fringe for simplicity 

Note: This repo is still a work in progress. Some of the code is yet to be commented and potentially structured better.
